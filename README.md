#### pdf_data_tables_extraction.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to extract tabular data from PDF files using Python. The notebook uses the tabula-py library to extract tables from PDFs and pandas library to manipulate and visualize the extracted data.

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

Introduction: A brief overview of the notebook and the libraries used.
Setup: Installation instructions for the required libraries.
Loading a PDF file: How to load a PDF file into the notebook using the PyPDF2 library.
Extracting tables from a PDF file: How to use the tabula-py library to extract tables from a PDF file.
Cleaning and manipulating the extracted data: How to use pandas to clean and manipulate the extracted data.

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries: tabula-py, pandas, PyPDF2, and OCR modules.

#### pdf_reader_bank_statements.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to read and extract information from bank statement PDF files using Python. The notebook uses the PyPDF2 library to read PDF files and regular expressions (regex) to extract relevant information from the statements.

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

Introduction: A brief overview of the notebook and the libraries used.
Setup: Installation instructions for the required libraries.
Loading a PDF file: How to load a PDF file into the notebook using the PyPDF2 library.
Extracting information from the PDF file: How to use regex to extract relevant information from the bank statement.
Cleaning and manipulating the extracted data: How to clean and manipulate the extracted data using pandas and other Python libraries.

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries: PyPDF2, pandas, and numpy. You will also need to have some sample bank statement PDF files available to work with.
